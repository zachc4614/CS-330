Added this since you didn't want the code as you stated in the annoucement. Assuming it applies here as well.

How do I approach designing software?

  You approach designing software by looking at what is needed and looking at the overall architecture of it.
  
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

  My skills in C++ and OpenGL have increased tremendously. Before this class I wasn't even aware of what OpenGL was.
  
What design process did you follow for your project work?

  The design process I always use is just finding a way to implement the software develop lifecycle somehow into what I'm doing. I adjust it depending on what I'm doing but it is what I'm most comfortable with.
  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  If anything this project taught me patience and learning to not give up when facing issues when development.
  
How do I approach developing programs?

  Approach it from an open-minded standpoint and looking at all feasible options to create whatever is neccessary.
  
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

  New strategies I learned are taking a multitude of information and goals that need to be met and correlated with one another and effectively applying it.
  
How did iteration factor into your development?

  Iteration helped me tremendously and it is the only way I look at developing projects. It makes everything simpler and easier to tackle in my opinion.
  
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  My approach to development has evolved by just having more awareness and facetime with it. It's led me to be more comfortable and gain more experience.
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  Computer Science can help me reach my goals as I'd love to work in cyber or be a software engineer one day. If I listen and continue to apply what I learn in every class I'll be on my way to achieving that goal.
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

  Computational graphics and visualizations give me tons of new knowledge and ways that I can see code being used and how to approach unique situations. Beforehand I would've never created anything like this or even thought of it. It opens more doors in my opinion such as working for a home development company. It could be very useful in that sense or a game development company.
